  "The journey of us began with a simple idea: to make transportation and deliveries more accessible, efficient, and safe for everyone. Founded in 2010, our mission was clear from the startâ€”revolutionize the way people move and receive goods by leveraging technology. We started small, offering taxi services in Indonesia, but quickly grew as more people saw the convenience of booking rides through a mobile app. As our user base expanded, so did our vision. We introduced delivery services, enabling customers to send and receive packages quickly, safely, and affordably. Whether it ss getting a ride or having groceries delivered, we aimed to provide solutions that simplified daily life.";
